<p class="content">A television program, also called television show, is a segment of content intended for broadcast on television.</p>
			

<p class="content">A television series that is intended to comprise a limited number of episodes is usually called a miniseries or serial. Series without a fixed length are usually divided into seasons or series, 
yearly or semiannual instalments of new episodes. While there is no defined length, US industry practice tends to favor longer seasons than those of some other countries.
A one-time broadcast may be called a "special", or particularly in the UK a "special episode". A television movie ("made-for-TV movie" or television film), is a film that is initially broadcast 
	on television rather than released in cinemas or direct-to-video, although many successful TV movies are later released on DVD.</p>
	

<p class="content">A program can be either recorded—as on video tape or other various electronic media forms—or considered live television.</p>
